# Pokémon: Alola Emerald

## Description:
This is a fork of the decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.

This is meant to be a continuation of the [Unova Red](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=413878) and [Kalos Crystal](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=416208) games by [Azure-Keys](https://github.com/Salsbar).

--- 

This is a mostly a vanilla version of Emerald and Generation 3, where the generations 1, 2 and 3 of Pokémon are the Unova, Kalos and Alolan Pokedexes, respectively. This game features all Pokémon from generations 5 and 6. To keep in line with Azure Keys' games, Emerald will be altered to provide all Pokémon in the Pokedex within a single playthrough.

## Features:
- Pokedex includes Gen 5, 6, 7 and Alolan form Pokémon (Victini - Zeorora + Alolan Rattata - Alolan Marrowak)
- All standard trade evolutions will use the link cable item. 
- All Evo methods except ^ previously mentioned are only existing ones from Pokémon Emerald.
- Fairy Type added, does SPECIAL damage
- Ghost is SPECIAL, Dark is PHYSICAL
- New moves added, replacing some old ones
- Moves, in general, match stats used in Gen 7 games
- Some TMs changed, refer to spoiler log for details
- TMs are still one-time use, however
- Some evolutions changed/made easier
- New Pokemon encounters/gifts have been added as well as an in-game way to get island tickets!

## Credits:
This ROM hack was made possible by the PokeEmerald Disassembly. Credits to everyone that worked to make that possible.
Thanks to the folks that shared the gba sprites for Gen 5, 6 and 7 from the pokeemerald-expansion project.
